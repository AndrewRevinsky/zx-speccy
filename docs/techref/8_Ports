                              PERIPHERAL PORTSWhen an port is read from (with 'IN') or written to (with 'OUT'), it willactivate a number of devices external to the Z80, depending on the portaddress. In general, devices respond if certain bits in the binaryrepresentation port number are set and/or reset, rather than to a specificport number; this is known as `partial decoding'. Whilst this makes thedecoding hardware easier to make, it does mean that a considerable amount ofcongestion has occured in the space available for new peripherals to respondto if they do not wish to clash with any current devices.The next complication is to do with the Z80's I/O instructions: it isquicker and easier to select the low 8 bits of the port number than it is toselect the high 8 bits; this means that, when outputting to peripherals forwhich the upper 8 bits make no difference, this will often be left unset,and may contain garbage. Thus, the 48K ULA, which responds to all even portaddresses, is often referred to as port #FE, rather than the full 16-bitport #FFFE.Listed below are some of the available peripherals (including those like theULA, which are in every machine), and the bit fields to which they respond.In the table, '-' means 'don't care', '0' means the bit must be reset forthe peripheral to respond, and '1' means it must be set.Peripheral           Port                 DescriptionTS2068 display mode  ---- ---- 1111 1111  48K ULA              ---- ---- ---- ---0  48K Tech Info | Port FETS2068 ULA           ---- ---- 1111 1110  As 48K ULA128K AY register     11-- ---- ---- --0-  128K Tech Info | Sound Chip128K AY data         10-- ---- ---- --0-  128K Tech Info | Sound Chip128K/+2 memory       0--- ---- ---- --0-  128K Tech Info | 128K Memory+2A/+3 memory        01-- ---- ---- --0-  128K Tech Info | 128K Memory+3 FDC data          0011 ---- ---- --0-  128K Tech Info | Disk Drive+3 FDC status        0010 ---- ---- --0-  128K Tech Info | Disk Drive+3 Memory            0001 ---- ---- --0-  128K Tech Info | +2A/+3 Memory+3 Centronics        0000 ---- ---- --0-  ZX Printer           ---- ---- ---- -0--  TS2040 / Alphacom 32 printer ---- ---- 1111 1011  Interface 1 RS232/ network             ---- ---- ---1 0---  48K Tech Info | Port F7Interface 1 control  ---- ---- ---0 1---  48K Tech Info | Port EFInterface 1  microdrive          ---- ---- ---0 0---  48K Tech Info | Port E7TS2068 AY data       ---- ---- 1111 0110  TS2068 AY register   ---- ---- 1111 0101TS2068 horizontal select register     ---- ---- 1111 0100Aerco Centronics Interface           ---- ---- 0111 1111Kempston joystick    ---- ---- 000- ----  48K Tech Info | JoysticksJLO status/command   ---- ---- 1000 1111JLO track            ---- ---- 1001 1111JLO sector           ---- ---- 1010 1111JLO data             ---- ---- 1011 1111JLO select           ---- ---- 1011 0111

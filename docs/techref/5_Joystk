                                 JOYSTICKSThe ports assigned to joysticks are:#7F    Fuller Box  (FxxxRLDU, active low)#1F    Kempston    (000FUDLR, active high)#EFFE  Sinclair1   (000LRDUF, active low, corresponds to keys '6' to '0')#F7FE  Sinclair2   (000FUDRL, active low, corresponds to keys '1' to '5')The TS2068 is slightly more complicated, as the joysticks attached to R14of sound chip; the following code is typical for reading the joysticks:  LD A,7  OUT (#F5),A   ;set R7  IN A,(#F6)  AND #BF       ;clear bit 6 to read from i/o port a - R14  OUT (#F6),A  LD A,14  OUT (#F5),A   ;set R14  LD A,3        ;(3=both joysticks, 2=left only, 1=right only)  IN A,(#F6)    ;(FxxxRLDU, active low)This method ensures other sound chip functions aren't messed with.

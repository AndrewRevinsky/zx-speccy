                                INTERFACE 1The Interface I is quite complicated. It uses three different I/O ports,and contains logic to page and unpage an 8K ROM if new commands are used.The ROM is paged if the processor executes the instruction at ROM address0008 or 1708 hexadecimal, the error and close# routines. It is inactivatedwhen the Z80 executes the RET at address 0700.                                  Port E7I/O port E7 is used to send or receive data to and from the microdrive.Accessing this port will halt the Z80 until the Interface I has collected8bits from the microdrive head; therefore, it the microdrive motor isn'trunning, or there is no formatted cartridge in the microdrive, theSpectrum hangs. This is the famous 'IN 0 crash'.                                  Port EF       Bit    7   6    5    4    3    2    1     0            +---------------------------------------+        READ|   |   |    |busy| dtr |gap| sync|write|            |   |   |    |    |     |   |     |prot.|            |---+---+----+----+-----+---+-----+-----|       WRITE|   |   |wait| cts|erase|r/w|comms|comms|            |   |   |    |    |     |   | clk | data|            +---------------------------------------+Bits DTR and CTS are used by the RS232 interface. The WAIT bit is used bythe Network to synchronise, GAP, SYNC, WR_PROT, ERASE, R/_W, COMMS CLK andCOMMS DATA are used by the microdrive system.                                  Port F7If the microdrive is not being used, the COMMS DATA output selects thefunction of bit 0 of out-port F7:       Bit      7    6   5   4   3   2   1       0            +------------------------------------------+        READ|txdata|   |   |   |   |   |   |    net    |            |      |   |   |   |   |   |   |   input   |            |------+---+---+---+---+---+---+-----------|       WRITE|      |   |   |   |   |   |   |net output/|            |      |   |   |   |   |   |   |   rxdata  |            +------------------------------------------+TXDATA and RXDATA are the input and output of the RS232 port. COMMS DATAdetermines whether bit 0 of F7 is output for the RS232 or the network.

                            THE +2A/+3 SPECTRUMSThe +2A/+3 share the same timing information, sound chip, etc as the128K/+2 machines; see above for details.Bit 6 of port #FE of the +2A/+3 does not show the same dependence on whatwas written to port #FE as it does on the other machines, and alwaysreturns 0 if there is no signal. Finally, reading from a non-existing port(eg #FF) will always return 255, and not give any screen/attribute bytesas it does on the 48K/128K/+2.                                   MemoryThe basic principle of paging on the +2A and +3 is the same as for the128K/+2. However, the +2A and +3 have four ROMs rather than two, andcertain extra memory configurations.Port 7FFDh behaves in the same way as before, except that bit 4 is now thelow bit of the ROM selection. The extra features are controlled by port1FFDh. This port is also write-only, and its last value should be saved at5B67h (23399).Port 1FFDh responds thus:  Bit 0: Paging mode. 0=normal, 1=special  Bit 1: In normal mode, ignored.  Bit 2: In normal mode, high bit of ROM selection. The four ROMs are:          ROM 0: 128k editor, menu system and self-test program          ROM 1: 128k syntax checker          ROM 2: +3DOS          ROM 3: 48 BASIC  Bit 3: Disk motor; 1=on, 0=off  Bit 4: Printer port strobe.When special mode is selected, the memory map changes to one of fourconfigurations specified in bits 1 and 2 of port 1FFDh:       Bit 2 =0    Bit 2 =0    Bit 2 =1    Bit 2 =1       Bit 1 =0    Bit 1 =1    Bit 1 =0    Bit 1 =1 FFFFh+--------+  +--------+  +--------+  +--------+      | Bank 3 |  | Bank 7 |  | Bank 3 |  | Bank 3 |      |        |  |        |  |        |  |        |      |        |  |        |  |        |  |        |      |        |  | screen |  |        |  |        | C000h+--------+  +--------+  +--------+  +--------+      | Bank 2 |  | Bank 6 |  | Bank 6 |  | Bank 6 |      |        |  |        |  |        |  |        |      |        |  |        |  |        |  |        |      |        |  |        |  |        |  |        | 8000h+--------+  +--------+  +--------+  +--------+      | Bank 1 |  | Bank 5 |  | Bank 5 |  | Bank 7 |      |        |  |        |  |        |  |        |      |        |  |        |  |        |  |        |      |        |  | screen |  | screen |  | screen | 4000h+--------+  +--------+  +--------+  +--------+      | Bank 0 |  | Bank 4 |  | Bank 4 |  | Bank 4 |      |        |  |        |  |        |  |        |      |        |  |        |  |        |  |        |      |        |  |        |  |        |  |        | 0000h+--------+  +--------+  +--------+  +--------+RAM banks 1,3,4 and 6 are used for the disc cache and RAMdisc, while Bank7 contains editor scratchpads and +3DOS workspace.The contended memory timings differ on the +2A/+3 from the earliermachines; firstly, the timing differences mean that the top-left pixel ofthe screen is displayed 14364 T-states after the 50 Hz interrupt occurs,as opposed to 14336. The T-states (relative to the interrupt) at whichdelays occur are given in the following table:      Cycle #    Delay      -------    -----       14361       1       14362   No delay       14363       7       14364       6       14365       5       14366       4       14367       3       14368       2       14369       1       14370   No delay       14371       7       14372       6and so on, until cycle 14490, when the display of the first scanline onthe screen has been completed, and no more delays are inserted until 14589(=14361+228) when the cycle repeats. The other difference occurs forinstructions which have multiple 'pc+1' or 'hl' entries in the breakdownfor the other machines: on the +2A/+3, these entries are combined intojust one. This means that, for example, JR becomes pc:4,pc+1:8.Like the base 128K machine, RAM banks 4-7 are contended. However, port #FEis not; whether ports #7FFD and #1FFD are contended is currently unknown.                                 Disk DriveAnother useful bit of information is that it is possible to add an Amiga3.5" drive to a Spectrum +3 by Simply wiring the pins by name andproviding it with some external power source (which can be an Amiga PSUwith increased amperage, used to power the entire +3 and external drive inone go). There is a public domain formatter around to format it to 720k -this is quite useful as 3" disks are now a rarity and were never thatreliable.The added advantage is that PC users equipped with a copy of Sybex'sshareware package 22Disk can read these files into a PC too.                                  [Image]
